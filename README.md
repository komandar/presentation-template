Creating publicly usable presentations takes a lot of time - especially if they are to be made available as a GitHub page. With this presentation template, you can quickly start creating your presentation and save time and energy.

## Install

Click the `Use this template` button at the top of this project's GitHub page, it looks like this:

## Configure GitHub Pages

Open your newly created repo and setup publishing at the settings tab of GitHub. Set the deploy branch to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Usage

Open your GitHub Pages site to see the content (link is shown at the GitHub Settings).
Out of the box you should see the content of the `SLIDES.md` as `/index.html`. The presentation is also converted into a PDF document (`/index.pdf`) and a PowerPoint Presentation (`/index.pptx`). 

Slides under the `docs/` folder are also converted.
